we want to build 
- a cpu similar to Atmel Atmega8
- a serial output with a fixed baud rate 
- an output for 7 segment diplay 

Folder structure
- app   : for building the program that will run on the CPU e.g. hello.c 
- simu  : for object files generated by ghdl
- src   : for VHDL source files for the CPU and avr_fpga.ucf
- test  : for a VHDL testbench
- tools : for tools end_conv and make_mem
- work  : working directory for ghdl
